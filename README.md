# tic-tac-toe
Description
This is a simple Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where a player competes against an AI. The game follows standard rules, and the AI plays optimally to ensure the best possible move.

Algorithm Used
Minimax Algorithm: The AI evaluates all possible moves, assigns a score, and chooses the move that maximizes its chances of winning.
Game State Checking: The program continuously checks for a win or draw after each move.
How It Works
The computer moves first using the Minimax algorithm.
The player inputs their move.
The game checks for a win or draw after each turn.
The process continues until a winner is found or the game ends in a draw.
